   - Detect ambiguities or missing context
   - Assess complexity and scope

2. **Add clarity and specificity**
   - Make requirements explicit
   - Add relevant context and constraints
   - Specify desired output format or style
   - Include technical details if needed

3. **Improve structure**
   - Break complex requests into clear steps
   - Organize information logically
   - Add examples to illustrate expectations
   - Remove redundancy and confusion
